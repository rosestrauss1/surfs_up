## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use SQAlchemy to connect to a SQLite database and perform queries. I used statistical analysis to to analyze data on weather.

## Results:
* The temperature in June wasan average of 79.4 degrees, with a max of 85 degrees and a minimum of 64

* The IQR was much broader for December than June, indicating that the temperatures in December occur further away from the average temperatures in December of 71 degrees.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
From a high level, it seems that the temperatures in the summer are stable and would be conducive to a successful ice cream buisness. The average temperature for June and December are only eight degrees different, so this means that opening up an ice cream shop in this location would probably be successful all throughout the year. Two additional queries I performed were to understand the differences between the weather in June and December not only through temperature, but also through percipitation. From these queries, it is clear that with June's average of 0.14 inches and December's 0.22 inches, the 0.08 inches would not be enough reason to not open the shop.
